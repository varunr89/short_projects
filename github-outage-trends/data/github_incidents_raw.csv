February 2026,Delays in UI updates for Actions Runs,minor,"Feb 3, 16:10 - 19:28 UTC","On February 3, 2026, between 14:00 UTC and 17:40 UTC, customers experienced delays in Webhook delivery for push events and delayed GitHub Actions workflow runs. During this window, Webhook deliveries for push events were delayed by up to 40 minutes, with an average delay of 10 minutes. GitHub Actions workflows triggered by push events experienced similar job start delays. Additionally, between 15:25 UTC and 16:05 UTC, all GitHub Actions workflow runs experienced status update delays of up to 11 minutes, with a median delay of 6 minutes.The issue stemmed from connection churn in our eventing service, which caused CPU saturation and delays for reads and writes, with subsequent downstream delivery delays for Actions and Webhooks. We have added observability tooling and metrics to accelerate detection, and are correcting stream processing client configuration to prevent recurrence.",https://www.githubstatus.com/incidents/f314nlctbfs5
February 2026,Incident with Copilot,minor,"Feb 3, 10:16 - 10:56 UTC","On February 3, 2026, between 09:35 UTC and 10:15 UTC, GitHub Copilot experienced elevated error rates, with an average of 4% of requests failing.This was caused by a capacity imbalance that led to resource exhaustion on backend services. The incident was resolved by infrastructure rebalancing, and we subsequently deployed additional capacity.We are improving observability to detect capacity imbalances earlier and enhancing our infrastructure to better handle traffic spikes.",https://www.githubstatus.com/incidents/zr4jt8bj1mg2
February 2026,Incident with Actions,major,"Feb 2, 19:03 - Feb 3, 00:56 UTC","On February 2, 2026, between 18:35 UTC and 22:15 UTC, GitHub Actions hosted runners were unavailable, with service degraded until full recovery at 23:10 UTC for standard runners and at February 3, 2026 00:30 UTC for larger runners. During this time, Actions jobs queued and timed out while waiting to acquire a hosted runner. Other GitHub features that leverage this compute infrastructure were similarly impacted, including Copilot Coding Agent, Copilot Code Review, CodeQL, Dependabot, GitHub Enterprise Importer, and Pages. All regions and runner types were impacted. Self-hosted runners on other providers were not impacted. This outage was caused by a backend storage access policy change in our underlying compute provider that blocked access to critical VM metadata, causing all VM create, delete, reimage, and other operations to fail. More information is available at https://azure.status.microsoft/en-us/status/history/?trackingId=FNJ8-VQZ. This was mitigated by rolling back the policy change, which started at 22:15 UTC.  As VMs came back online, our runners worked through the backlog of requests that hadn’t timed out. We are working with our compute provider to improve our incident response and engagement time, improve early detection before they impact our customers, and ensure safe rollout should similar changes occur in the future. We recognize this was a significant outage to our users that rely on GitHub’s workloads and apologize for the impact this had.",https://www.githubstatus.com/incidents/xwn6hjps36ty
February 2026,Incident with Codespaces,major,"Feb 2, 20:17 - Feb 3, 00:54 UTC","On February 2, 2026, GitHub Codespaces were unavailable between 18:55 and 22:20 UTC and degraded until the service fully recovered at February 3, 2026 00:15 UTC. During this time, Codespaces creation and resume operations failed in all regions. This outage was caused by a backend storage access policy change in our underlying compute provider that blocked access to critical VM metadata, causing all VM create, delete, reimage, and other operations to fail.

While deploying an internal service, a misconfiguration caused a small subset of traffic to route to a service that was not ready. During the incident we observed the degradation and statused publicly.To mitigate the issue, traffic was redirected to healthy instances and we resumed normal operation.We are improving our monitoring and deployment processes in this area to avoid future routing issues.",https://www.githubstatus.com/incidents/vj8q32xs2d32
January 2026,Degraded Experience - Failing to finalize some CCA Jobs,minor,"Jan 30, 20:59 - 21:22 UTC","Between 2026-01-30 19:06 UTC and 2026-01-30 20:04 UTC, Copilot Coding Agent experienced sessions getting stuck, with a mismatch between the UI-reported session status and the underlying Actions and job execution state. Impacted users could observe Actions finish successfully but the session UI continuing to show in-progress state, or sessions remaining in queued state.The issue was caused by a feature flag that resulted in events being published to a new Kafka topic. Publishing failures led to buffer/queue overflows in the shared event publishing client, preventing other critical events from being emitted. We mitigated the incident by disabling the feature flag and redeploying production pods, which resumed normal event delivery. We are working to improve safeguards and detection around event publishing failures to reduce time to mitigation for similar issues in the future.",https://www.githubstatus.com/incidents/szwg1z6zjsvx
January 2026,Actions Workflows Run Start Delays,minor,"Jan 28, 15:12 - 15:54 UTC","On Jan 28, 2026, between 14:56 UTC and 15:44 UTC, GitHub Actions experienced degraded performance. During this time, workflows experienced an average delay of 49 seconds, and 4.7% of workflow runs failed to start within 5 minutes. The root cause was an atypical load pattern that overwhelmed system capacity and caused resource contention.Recovery began once additional resources came online at 15:25 UTC, with full recovery at 15:44 UTC. We are implementing safeguards to prevent this failure mode and enhancing our monitoring to detect and address similar patterns more quickly in the future.",https://www.githubstatus.com/incidents/22zx8fw9qt4t
January 2026,Regression in windows runners for public repositories,minor,"Jan 26, 19:25 - 23:51 UTC","On Jan 26, 2026, from approximately 14:03 UTC to 23:42 UTC, GitHub Actions experienced job failures on some Windows standard hosted runners. This was caused by a configuration difference in a new Windows runner type that caused the expected D: drive to be missing. About 2.5% of all Windows standard runners jobs were impacted. Re-run of failed workflows had a high chance of succeeding given the limited rollout of the change.The job failures were mitigated by rolling back the affected configuration and removing the provisioned runners that had this configuration. To reduce the chance of recurrence, we are expanding runner telemetry and improving validation of runner configuration changes. We are also evaluating options to accelerate the mitigation time of any similar future events.",https://www.githubstatus.com/incidents/90hj03y5tj3c
January 2026,Disruption with repo creation,minor,"Jan 25, 02:43 - 03:08 UTC","Between January 24, 2026,19:56 UTC and January 25, 2026, 2:50 UTC repository creation and clone were degraded. On average, the error rate was 25% and peaked at 55% of requests for repository creation. This was due to increased latency on the repositories database impacting a read-after-write problem during repo creation. We mitigated the incident by stopping an operation that was generating load on the database to increase throughput. We have identified the repository creation problem and are working to address the issue and improve our observability to reduce our time to detection and mitigation of issues like this one in the future.",https://www.githubstatus.com/incidents/g697qcy5dsks
January 2026,Disruption with some GitHub services,minor,"Jan 22, 14:12 - 15:22 UTC","On January 22, 2026, our authentication service experienced an issue between 14:00 UTC and 14:50 UTC, resulting in downstream disruptions for users.From 14:00 UTC to 14:23 UTC, authenticated API requests experienced higher-than-normal error rates, with an average of 16.9% and occasional peaks up to 22.2% resulting in HTTP 401 responses for authenticated API requests. From 14:00 UTC to 14:50 UTC, git operations over HTTP were impacted, with error rates averaging 3.8% and peaking at 10.8%. As a result, some users may have been unable to run git commands as expected.This was due to the authentication service reaching the maximum allowed number of database connections. We mitigated the incident by increasing the maximum number of database connections in the authentication service.We are adding additional monitoring around database connection pool usage and improving our traffic projection to reduce our time to detection and mitigation of issues like this one in the future.",https://www.githubstatus.com/incidents/cqb5hcy0gx18
January 2026,Policy pages for Copilot are timing out,minor,"Jan 21, 19:31 - 20:53 UTC","On January 21, between 17:50 and 20:53 UTC, around 350 enterprises and organizations experienced slower load times or timeouts when viewing Copilot policy pages. The issue was traced to performance degradation under load due to an issue in upstream database caching capability within our billing infrastructure, which increased query latency to retrieve billing and policy information from approximately 300ms to up to 1.5s.To restore service, we disabled the affected caching feature, which immediately returned performance to normal. We then addressed the issue in the caching capability and re-enabled our use of the database cache and observed continued recovery.Moving forward, we’re tightening our procedures for deploying performance optimizations, adding test coverage, and improving cross-service visibility and alerting so we can detect upstream degradations earlier and reduce impact to customers.",https://www.githubstatus.com/incidents/6d5kv6l8d8q3
January 2026,Copilot Chat - Grok Code Fast 1 Outage,minor,"Jan 21, 11:33 - 12:38 UTC","On Jan 21st, 2025, between 11:15 UTC and 13:00 UTC the Copilot service was degraded for Grok Code Fast 1 model. On average, more than 90% of the requests to this model failed due to an issue with an upstream provider. No other models were impacted.The issue was resolved after the upstream provider fixed the problem that caused the disruption. GitHub will continue to enhance our monitoring and alerting systems to reduce the time it takes to detect and mitigate similar issues in the future.",https://www.githubstatus.com/incidents/qq1gg4klp5vm
January 2026,Run start delays in Actions,minor,"Jan 20, 19:49 - 20:10 UTC","On January 20, 2026, between 19:08 UTC and 20:18 UTC, manually dispatched GitHub Actions workflows saw delayed job starts. GitHub products built on Actions such as Dependabot, Pages builds, and Copilot coding agent experienced similar delays. All jobs successfully completed despite the delays. At peak impact, approximately 23% of workflow runs were affected, with an average delay of 11 minutes.This was caused by a load pattern shift in Actions scheduled jobs that saturated a shared backend resource. We mitigated the incident by temporarily throttling traffic and scaling up resources to account for the change in load pattern. To prevent recurrence, we have scaled resources appropriately and implemented optimizations to prevent this load pattern in the future.",https://www.githubstatus.com/incidents/fw294tth5m8y
January 2026,Incident affecting actions-runner-controller,minor,"Jan 20, 16:02 - 16:23 UTC","On January 20, 2026, between 14:39 UTC and 16:03 UTC, actions-runner-controller users experienced a 1% failure rate for API requests managing GitHub Actions runner scale sets. This caused delays in runner creation, resulting in delayed job starts for workflows targeting those runners. The root cause was a service to service circuit breaker that incorrectly tripped for all users when a single user hit rate limits for runner registration. The issue was mitigated by bypassing the circuit breaker, and users saw immediate and full service recovery following the fix.We have updated our circuit breakers to exclude individual customer rate limits from their triggering logic and are continuing work to improve detection and mitigation times.",https://www.githubstatus.com/incidents/m4xfyzd8mn2n
January 2026,Disruption with some GitHub services,minor,"Jan 16, 23:53 - Jan 17, 02:54 UTC","Between 2026-01-16 16:17 and 2026-01-17 02:54 UTC, some Copilot Business users were unable to access and use certain Copilot features and models. This was due to a bug with how we determine if a user has access to a feature, inadvertently marking features and models as inaccessible for users whose enterprise(s) had not configured the policy.We mitigated the incident by reverting the problematic deployment. We are improving our internal monitoring and mitigation processes to reduce the risk and extended downtime of similar incidents in the future.",https://www.githubstatus.com/incidents/zltcsbhqmvqq
January 2026,Incident with Issues and Pull Requests,major,"Jan 15, 16:56 - 18:54 UTC","On January 15, 2026,  between 16:40 UTC and 18:20 UTC, we observed increased latency and timeouts across Issues, Pull Requests, Notifications, Actions, Repositories, API, Account Login and Alive. An average 1.8% of combined web and API requests saw failure, peaking briefly at 10% early on. The majority of impact was observed for unauthenticated users, but authenticated users were impacted as well.This was caused by an infrastructure update to some of our data stores. Upgrading this infrastructure to a new major version resulted in unexpected resource contention, leading to distributed impact in the form of slow queries and increased timeouts across services that depend on these datasets. We mitigated this by rolling back to the previous stable version.We are working to improve our validation process for these types of upgrades to catch issues that only occur under high load before full release, improve detection time, and reduce mitigation times in the future.",https://www.githubstatus.com/incidents/q987xpbqjbpl
January 2026,Actions workflow run and job status updates are experiencing delays,minor,"Jan 15, 14:24 - 15:26 UTC","On January 15th, between 14:18 UTC and 15:26 UTC, customers experienced delays in status updates for workflow runs and checks. Status updates were delayed by up to 20 minutes, with a median delay of 11 minutes.The issue stemmed from an infrastructure upgrade to our database cluster. The new version introduced resource contention under production load, causing slow query times. We mitigated this by rolling back to the previous stable version. We are working to strengthen our upgrade validation process to catch issues that only manifest under high load. We are also adding new monitors to reduce detection time for similar issues in the future.",https://www.githubstatus.com/incidents/5ccghcfrkv39
January 2026,Incident with Webhooks,minor,"Jan 14, 20:21 - 21:38 UTC","On January 14, 2026, between 19:34 UTC and 21:36 UTC, the Webhooks service experienced a degradation that delayed delivery of some webhooks. During this window, a subset of webhook deliveries that encountered proxy tunnel errors on their initial delivery attempt were delayed by more than two minutes. The root cause was a recent code change that added additional retry attempts for this specific error condition, which increased delivery times for affected webhooks. Previously, webhook deliveries encountering this error would not have been delivered.The incident was mitigated by rolling back the change, restoring normal webhook delivery. As a corrective action, we will update our monitoring to measure the webhook delivery latency critical path, ensuring that incidents are accurately scoped to this workflow.",https://www.githubstatus.com/incidents/j7yjswzyrktp

We mitigated this by deleting the runner.The routing configuration is not something controlled externally. A manual override was done previously for internal testing, but left incorrect metadata for a large runner instance. An infrastructure migration caused this misconfigured runner to come online which started the incorrect assignments. We are removing the ability to manually override this configuration entirely, and are adding alerting to identify possible OS mismatches for hosted runner jobs.As a reminder, hosted runner VMs are secure and ephemeral, with every VM reimaged after every single job. All jobs impacted here were originally targeted at a GitHub-owned VM image and were run on a GitHub-owned VM image.",https://www.githubstatus.com/incidents/17lxd87h22fj

All jobs successfully completed despite the delays. At peak impact, approximately 8% of workflow runs were affected.During this incident, some nodes received a spike in workflow events that led to queuing of event processing. Because runs are pinned to nodes, runs being processed by these nodes saw delays in starting or showing as completed. The team was alerted to this at 8:58 UTC. Impacted nodes were disabled from processing new jobs to allow queues to drain.We have increased overall processing capacity and are implementing safeguards to better balance load across all nodes when spikes occur.

The incident was triggered by a buildup of synchronization requests, resulting in elevated Redis key usage and high CPU consumption on the underlying Redis cluster.To mitigate further impact, we proactively paused all team synchronization requests between 3:00 pm UTC and 8:15 pm UTC, allowing us to stabilize the Redis cluster. Our engineering team also resolved the issue by flushing the affected Redis keys and queues, which promptly stopped runaway growth and restored service health. Additionally, we scaled up our infrastructure resources to improve our ability to process the high volume of synchronization requests. All pending team synchronizations were successfully processed following service restoration.We are working to strengthen the Team Synchronization service by implementing a killswitch, adding throttling to prevent excessive enqueueing of synchronization requests, and improving the scheduler to avoid duplicate job requests.

Approximately 57% of codespaces were affected during this incident, during which some customers may have observed incomplete or delayed billing usage information in their dashboards and usage reports, and may not have received timely notifications about approaching usage or spending limits. The incident was caused by an increase in the number of jobs in our worker pool without a corresponding increase in capacity, resulting in a backlog of unprocessed Codespaces billing jobs. We mitigated the issue by scaling up worker capacity, allowing the backlog to clear and billing data to catch up. We started seeing recovery immediately at 17:40 UTC and were fully caught up by 19:04 UTC.To prevent recurrence, we are moving critical billing jobs into a dedicated worker pool monitored by the Codespaces team, and are reviewing alerting thresholds to ensure more rapid detection and mitigation of delays in the future.",https://www.githubstatus.com/incidents/6nxmxxqcgmh7

On average, 26% of jobs requiring large runners had a >5min delay getting a runner assigned.  This was caused by the rollback of a configuration change and a latent bug in event processing, which was triggered by the mixed data shape that resulted from the rollback.  The processing would reprocess the same events unnecessarily and cause the background job that manages large runner creation and deletion to run out of resources.  It would automatically restart and continue processing, but the jobs were not able to keep up with production traffic.  We mitigated the impact by using a feature flag to bypass the problematic event processing logic.  While these changes had been rolling out in stages over the last few months and had been safely rolled back previously, an unrelated change prevented rollback from causing this problem in earlier stages.We are reviewing and updating the feature flags in this event processing workflow to ensure that we have high confidence in rollback in all rollout stages.

The increased error rate caused a broad impact across our services, such as the inability to log in, view a repository, open a pull request, and comment on issues. The errors were caused by our web servers being overloaded as a result of planned maintenance that unintentionally caused our live updates service to fail to start. As a result of the live updates service being down, clients reconnected aggressively and overloaded our servers.We only marked Issues as affected during this incident despite the broad impact. This oversight was due to a gap in our alerting while our web servers were overloaded. The engineering team's focus on restoring functionality led us to not identify the broad scope of the impact to customers until the incident had already been mitigated.We mitigated the incident by rolling back the changes from the planned maintenance to the live updates service and scaling up the service to handle the influx of traffic from WebSocket clients.We are working to reduce the impact of the live updates service's availability on github.com to prevent issues like this one in the future.

The overall error rate during this period was 4.2%, with a peak error rate of 12.5%. The root cause was traced to a bug in a build script for a component that runs on the file servers that host git repository data. The build script incurred an error that did not cause the overall build process to fail, resulting in a faulty set of artifacts being deployed to production.To mitigate the impact, we rolled back the affecting deployment.  To prevent further occurrences of this cause in the future, we will be addressing the underlying cause of the ignored build failure and improving metrics and alerting for the resulting production failure scenarios.",https://www.githubstatus.com/incidents/q3xqwmcxzkqq

Customers who deploy Pages from a source branch experienced delayed runs. Approximately 1,100 runs were delayed long enough to get marked as abandoned. The runs that weren't abandoned completed successfully after we recovered from the incident. Actions jobs experienced average delays of 23 minutes, with some jobs experiencing delays as high as 45 minutes. During the course of the incident, 17% of runs were delayed by more than 5 minutes. At peak, as many as 80% of runs experienced delays exceeding 5 minutes. The root cause was a misconfiguration in the service that manages runner connections, which caused CPU throttling and led to a performance degradation in that service.We mitigated the incident by diverting runner connections away from the misconfigured nodes.

On average, delivery delays were 24 minutes, with a maximum of 71 minutes. This was caused by a configuration change to the Webhooks service, which led to unauthenticated requests sent to the background job cluster. The configuration error was repaired and re-deploying the service solved the issue. However, this created a thundering herd effect which overloaded the background job queue cluster which put its API layer at max capacity, resulting in timeouts for other job clients, which presented as increased latency for API calls.Shortly after resolving the authentication misconfiguration, we had a separate issue in the background job processing service where health probes were failing, leading to reduced capacity in the background job API layer which magnified the effects of the thundering herd. From 18:21 UTC to 21:14 UTC, Actions runs on PRs experienced approximately 2 minutes delay and maximum of 12 minutes delay.

Actions jobs themselves were unaffected, this issue affected the timeliness of UI updates, with an average delay of 11m 40s and a maximum of 20m 14s.This incident was due to a performance problem on a single processing node, where Actions UI updates were being processed.  Additionally, a misconfigured monitor did not alert immediately, resulting in a 25m late detection time and a 37m total increase in time to mitigate.

Approximately 25% of all runs targeting larger hosted runners queued during this time were slow to start, with a median wait time of 1 minute, 55 seconds.The issue was caused by a downstream dependency overloading, which impacted our machine setup process. Each larger hosted runner job is run on a fresh VM, and one of the setup steps is installing the Actions agent. Up to the point of this incident, we would pull the latest agent version from the GitHub release and install it on the VM. However, during this incident the speciific GitHub release for the Linux x64 Actions agent became overloaded, and our agent downloads were severely throttled. This throttling led to timeouts during the download, and caused our hosted runner system to conclude the VMs were failing to start. We need the Actions agent online to start serving jobs, and with the download timing out, our service assumed the runner wasn't starting up successfully. This failure to start up led to those VMs being reset again and again instead of serving jobs. We mitigated the issue by falling back to a cached version of the Actions agent present on our image.We have further refined the fallback system to automatically use the cached agent binaries, and added new functionality to allow for easier agent downloading from other locations.

The problem was identified, and a status update was provided shortly after. A mitigation strategy was implemented by 14:30 UTC, which mitigated the impact.The root cause of the incident was a combination of issues in the request handling process. Specifically, some requests were malformed, which resulted in being incorrectly routed to the wrong deployment. That deployment wasn’t resilient to the malformed requests and resulted in errors.To mitigate the immediate impact, requests were routed away from the failing deployment.

We also saw slightly elevated error rates across the service, with an average error rate of 0.1%, peaking to 0.31% of requests. The underlying cause of the incident was a repeated problematic query that resulted in MySQL replicas crashing, which caused a back-up in the jobs that compute whether PRs can be merged.At 16:30 the incident self-mitigated when the volume of the problematic query decreased. Concurrent to this, we deployed a mitigation to remove the mergability polling code from the PR experience to alleviate pressure on MySQL servers. This mitigation caused the merge button to not automatically enable, but require a page refresh instead. At 17:40 we statused PRs again for this issue. We rolled back the mitigation to resolve the second incident at 18:20.Going forward, to improve mitigation we are investing in faster recovery from cascading read-replica crashes, improving query retry logic to more aggressively back off when read replicas are unhealthy, improving our ability to diagnose server crashes and trace them back to user activity, and making it easier to block problematic queries.To prevent recurrence, we are eliminating the query that caused the server to crash, improving our detection and mitigation of problematic queries, and investigating and remediating the underlying issues that caused MySQL to crash.

At 14:21 UTC on April 14th, community reports of this were confirmed and an incident declared. Emails most impacted by the delay were password reset and unrecognized device verification, which contain time-sensitive links or verification codes, and are required to be acted on in order for password resets or unrecognized logins to proceed. Users attempting to reset their password during the incident were unable to complete the reset. Users without two-factor authentication (2FA), signing in on an unrecognized device, were unable to complete device verification. Enterprise Managed Users, users with 2FA, and users on recognized devices or IP addresses were still able to sign in. This impacted 800-1000 user device verifications and 300-400 password resets. The mailer delays were caused by increased usage of a shared resource pool; a separate internal job queue became unhealthy and prevented the mailer queue from being worked on. We have made some immediate improvements to better detect and react to this type of situation again. As a short-term mitigation strategy, we have added a queue-bypass ability for  time-sensitive emails, like password reset and unrecognized device verification. We can enable this setting if we observe email delays reoccurring, which will ensure that future incidents do not affect user ability to complete critical login flows.

New GitHub Codespaces could not be created, as were Codespaces sessions that required minting a new auth token.Actions saw delays and infrastructure failures due to the upstream dependency on fetching tokens for the repository for runs to successfully execute. GitHub Pages were affected due to the impact on Actions, resulting in 1266 page builds failing, which at the low point represented 33% of page builds failing. This resulted in page edits not being reflected on those impacted sites.We deployed an application update that included a newer version of our database query builder. The new version uses a newer MySQL syntax for upsert queries that is not supported by the database proxy service we use for some of our production-environment database clusters. This incompatibility impacted the permissions cluster specifically, causing requests that attempted such queries to fail.We responded by rolling back the deployment, restoring the previous query use, and thus mitigated the incident.We have identified and corrected a misconfiguration of the permissions cluster in our development and CI environments that will ensure queries utilize the proxy service to prevent future syntax additions causing issues in production.",https://www.githubstatus.com/incidents/9ym5p2sg6w5v

During this incident, the following customer impacts occurred: API error rates as high as 1%, Copilot error rates as high as 17%, and Secret Scanning and 2FA using GitHub Mobile error rates as high as 100% followed by a drop in error rates to 30% starting at 22:55 UTC. This elevated error rate was due to a degradation of our centralized authentication service upon which many other services depend.The issue was caused by a deployment of network related configuration that was inadvertently applied to the incorrect environment. This error was detected within 4 minutes and a rollback was initiated. While error rates began dropping quickly at 22:55 UTC, the rollback failed in one of our data centers, leading to a longer recovery time. At this point, many failed requests succeeded upon retrying. This failure was due to an unrelated issue that had occurred earlier in the day where the datastore for our configuration service was polluted in a way that required manual intervention. The bad data in the configuration service caused the rollback in this one datacenter to fail. A manual removal of the incorrect data allowed the full rollback to complete at 00:48 UTC thereby restoring full access to services. We understand how the corrupt data was deployed and continue to investigate why the specific data caused the subsequent deployments to fail.We are working on various measures to ensure safety of this kind of configuration change, faster detection of the problem via better monitoring of the related subsystems, and improvements to the robustness of our underlying configuration system including prevention and automatic cleanup of polluted records such that we can automatically recover from this kind of data issue in the future.",https://www.githubstatus.com/incidents/fr6fgvdn41sw

Approximately 3.7% of runs queued during this time were unable to start.The issue was partially caused by a deployment of an internal system Actions relies on to process workflow run events. The pausing of the queue processing during this deployment for about 3 minutes caused a spike in queued workflow runs. When this queue began to be processed, the high number of queued workflows overwhelmed a secret-initialization component of the workflow invocation system. The errors generated by this overwhelmed system ultimately delayed workflow invocation. Through our alerting system, we received initial indications of an issue at approximately 18:44 UTC. However, we did not initially see impact on our run start delays and run queuing availability metrics until approximately 18:52 UTC. As the large queue of workflow run events burned down, we saw recovery in our key customer impact measures by 19:11 UTC, but waited to declare the incident resolved at 19:22 UTC while verifying there was no further customer impact.We are working on various measures to reduce spikes in queue build up during deployments of our queueing system, and have scaled up the workers which handle secret generation and storage during the workflow invocation process.",https://www.githubstatus.com/incidents/bgnqgwyj76l4

An average of 0.12% and max of 1.30% of requests hit 5xx errors and timeouts for web and API requests during this period. The majority of impact was mitigated at 22:10, with a lower rate of failures ending by 22:50. This issue was caused by unhandled exceptions during routine maintenance of our internal networking hosts. Hosts that were thought to be no longer serving traffic were removed from service which led to the initial errors. Recovery took longer than expected because of issues in our automated recovery tooling. As a result, manual intervention was performed to remove the unhealthy hosts and requests returned to normal. The bug in the automated recovery tooling has been fixed and we’ve made changes to prevent unintended removal of hosts that are serving traffic.",https://www.githubstatus.com/incidents/d3mfyt4nqnv5

November 2023,Incident with Actions and Webhooks,minor,"Nov 28, 17:24 - 17:59 UTC","This incident has been resolved. An interaction between two feature flag rollouts caused us to suppress delivery of push webhooks between 16:23 and 17:11 UTC in a manner that evaded our existing observability. This affected 71,000 repositories whose users will have noted missing webhook deliveries and/or experienced Actions jobs with push triggers failing to start. During this period, around 25% of new Actions jobs were impacted. The issues were resolved by disabling one of the feature flags in question.

After weighing various options for retroactively dispatching old push webhooks, we concluded that the risk of delivering stale data to customers with these redeliveries outweighed the possible benefit.

On November 27, 2023 at 18:46 UTC, we attempted to rotate our OpenID Connect (OIDC) authentication flow certificates. Due to an error in the certificate formatting, we uploaded an invalid certificate configuration that was not observed in our pre-production testing. Our background job servers were unable to start because a valid configuration is required at worker start up. As a result, users experienced delays in Pull Requests, Webhooks, Issues, Actions and Projects. Rollback of the change was slowed by the invalid certificate as our deployment system relied on the same certificate. Rollback was completed at 20:35 UTC. Most services recovered by 20:44 UTC. 

Delayed updates to Issues and Pull Requests were applied normally once the changes were rolled back. After the change was rolled back, a large queue of Actions-related jobs built up which included Pull Request, Pull Request review and Pull Request review comment events. About 2.3% of Actions jobs failed during the duration of the incident. Job queue times returned to normal once all remaining jobs were processed.

After a quick mitigation, we began to see recovery on the job queues by 10:02 UTC. During this time window 100% of Actions jobs were delayed in starting for up to 11 minutes.Unfortunately, the rapid queue recovery sent a thundering herd of jobs to Actions hosted runner pools, causing a database deadlock that resulted in some hosted runner pools having increased latency when accepting new jobs. This affected only a small percentage of overall jobs, around 2%.

This delay affected various services utilizing background jobs, including Actions, Webhooks, Pull Requests, and Pages. The impact persisted for approximately one hour until 2:10 UTC.

During the incident, some customers experienced delays in starting Github Actions workflow runs and Pages builds. We estimate that about 10% of Actions workflow runs were delayed during the impact window and 99% of Pages builds failed from 1:00 UTC to 1:20 UTC. Users may have experienced a delay in seeing recent pushes reflected in pull request views. This delay averaged between 5 and 10 minutes and affected up to 30% of pull request page views during the incident. 1% of pull request page views experienced delays of up to 60 minutes. Finally, 30% of webhook deliveries in this window missed our target of being delivered within 1 minute of the triggering event.

This incident was caused by excessive rebalancing in our Kafka consumer group that feeds our background job system. We have altered our Kafka configuration to reduce the likelihood of this issue, created diagnostic tools to identify future causes, and will be breaking up this relay into multiple groups to limit the blast radius if the problem does reoccur.",https://www.githubstatus.com/incidents/wyk0ns67krlz

November 2023,"Incident with Git Operations, Issues, Pull Requests, Actions, API Requests, Codespaces, Packages, Pages and Webhooks",major,"Nov 3, 16:10 - 19:21 UTC","A performance and resilience optimization to the authorization microservice contained a memory leak that was exposed under high traffic. This resulted in a number of pages returning 404’s that should not have. Testing the build in our canary ring did not expose the service to sufficient traffic to discover the leak, allowing it to graduate to production at 6:37 PM UTC.  The memory leak under high load caused pods to crash repeatedly starting at 6:42 PM UTC, failing authorization checks. These failures triggered alerts at 6:44 PM UTC. Rolling back the authorization service change was delayed as parts of the deployment infrastructure relied on the authorization service and required manual intervention to complete. Rollback completed at 7:08 PM UTC and all impacted GitHub features recovered after pods came back online.  We are evaluating changes to our rollout strategy to better detect this sooner and with less impact, changes to remove the dependency between authorization services and deployment rollback, and incident response improvements to reduce the overall time to recover.

This incident is unrelated to the Slack integration incident.  The combined status updates are a limitation of our status reporting tooling and we recognize the confusion this creates.

October 2023,Incident with Pull Requests,minor,"Oct 5, 14:18 - 16:42 UTC","On October 5, 2023 at 13:40 UTC, our monitoring systems observed an increase in the time it was taking for Git pushes to become visible when viewing commits in Pull Requests. Under normal operating conditions, a series of asynchronous jobs runs in response to every push and within a few seconds applies a number of side-effects in Pull Requests such as requesting reviews, marking Pull Requests as merged, and showing new commits. During the incident, jobs were entering the queue faster than we could process them, resulting in processing delays as high as 75 seconds on average, and as much as 15 minutes in the worst case. About 10% of all Pull Request page loads were showing out-of-date data during this time.

We had recently created a dedicated worker pool for processing these side-effects, with the goal of improving isolation between services and providing product teams with more direct control over critical parts of the system.

During the incident, some customers experienced delays in starting Github Actions workflow runs and receiving status updates for in-progress runs. The root cause was identified to be a change that was deployed to an internal distributed event streaming platform which resulted in several worker nodes to go over a misconfigured memory limit. This caused these nodes to restart leading to a reduced job processing throughput. Github Actions relies on events delivered through this event streaming platform to start workflow runs and update their status. Delays in receiving these events led to run delays for about 40% of the Actions workflows.
	
We mitigated this through a rollback of the offending change at 00:18 UTC. This allowed our event streaming platform to catch up with the backlog of workflow runs that were queued during the incident. The backlog was processed by 00:44 UTC.

June 2023,Incident On 2023-06-29,critical,"Jun 29, 17:52 - 18:36 UTC","From 17:39-18:12 UTC GitHub was down in parts of North America, particularly the US East coast, and South America. 

GitHub takes measures to ensure that we have redundancy in our system for various disaster scenarios. We have been working on building redundancy to an earlier single point of failure in our network architecture at a second Internet edge facility. This second Internet edge facility was completed in January and has been actively routing production traffic since then. Today we were performing a live failover test to validate that we could in fact use this second Internet edge facility if the primary were to fail. Unfortunately, during this failover we inadvertently caused a production outage.

During the test we exposed that the secondary site had a network pathing configuration issue that prevented it from properly functioning as the primary facility. This caused issues with Internet connectivity to GitHub, ultimately resulting in an outage. We were immediately notified of the issue in our monitoring and alerting. Within two minutes of being alerted we reverted the change and brought the primary facility back online. Once online it took time for traffic to be rebalanced and for our border routers to reconverge restoring public connectivity to affected GitHub systems.

This failover test helped expose the configuration issue, and we are addressing the gaps in both configuration and our failover testing which will help make GitHub more resilient. We recognize the severity of this outage and apologize for the impact it has to our customers.",https://www.githubstatus.com/incidents/gqx5l06jjxhp
