      "comment": "check our research notes, the shape of this graph is no accurate. the top 5% account for 26% of the productivity. and here the gains are only 7-17%. we should combine 2 graphs Ai adoption rate and impact of AI on productivity. the end result it shows is that AI adoption is focused in the part of the curve there the effect is less. so the overall integral is lower.",
