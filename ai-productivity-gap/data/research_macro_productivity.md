- Year-over-year: **+1.9%** vs Q3 2024
- Output +5.4%, hours worked +0.5%, unit labor costs -1.9%
- Q4 2025 data scheduled for March 5, 2026

## 2. Is AI Showing Up in Aggregate Productivity?

**Short answer: Not yet, in a measurable way.**

### Kansas City Fed (Feb 2026) -- "A New U.S. Productivity Chapter?"
- U.S. labor productivity has risen above pre-pandemic trend since late 2022
- But the pickup is **not broad-based** -- a small set of industries account for most gains
- "While higher AI adoption is associated with faster productivity growth across industries, **it explains little of the shift in aggregate contributions**, suggesting AI adoption is still spreading."

### San Francisco Fed / Richmond Fed (Apr 2025) -- "The Productivity Puzzle"
- Directly invokes Solow's 1987 observation: "remains relevant today"
- GenAI adoption reached ~40% of U.S. adults 18-64 by Aug 2024
- Users reported saving 5.4% of work hours (~2.2 hours/week)
- "Although AI adoption aligns with faster productivity growth across industries, **it explains little of the aggregate gain in productivity.**"

### CNBC Analysis (Jan 26, 2026)
- Net average AI-related investment contribution: **40-50 basis points** (20-25% of real GDP growth, Q1-Q3 2025)
- Consumer spending, not AI capex, was largest GDP growth driver

## 3. Updated Estimates from Institutions

### Penn Wharton Budget Model (Sep 2025)
- AI's impact on aggregate TFP growth: **0.01 percentage points** currently

### Dallas Fed (Jun 2025)
- "Reasonable scenario": AI could boost annual productivity growth by **0.3 percentage points** for the next decade
- This would mean a difference in GDP per capita in 2050 of "only a few thousand dollars"
- Source: [Dallas Fed](https://www.dallasfed.org/research/economics/2025/0624)

### WEF Chief Economists (Jan 2026, Davos)
- Bullish on AI productivity gains "within the next year or two"
- EY-Parthenon: AI could lift economy-wide labour productivity by **1.5% to 3% over the next decade**
- IT sector expected to adopt fastest
- Source: WEF Chief Economists' Outlook January 2026

### Fed Vice Chair Jefferson (Nov 7, 2025) -- "AI and the Economy"
- Cited Brynjolfsson: AI increased customer support productivity by 14% on average
- Worker adoption of gen AI rose from 30.1% (Dec 2024) to 45.9% (Jun-Jul 2025)
- "It is likely still too soon to tell" what AI's actual economic effects will be
- Counseled "exercising humility"

## 4. St. Louis Fed -- Tracking AI's GDP Contribution

### Original (Nov 2025): "The State of Generative AI Adoption in 2025"
- Work adoption: 33.3% to 37.4% (12-month increase)
- Share of work hours using gen AI: 4.1% (Nov 2024) to 5.7% (Aug 2025)

### Follow-up (Jan 2026): "Tracking AI's Contribution to GDP Growth"
- AI-related categories contributed **0.97 percentage points** to real GDP growth (Q1-Q3 2025)
- This drove **39% of American GDP growth**
- Same categories drove **28% of GDP growth in 2000** (dot-com era)
- Software hit "new historical peak" in Q2 2025 at 0.57pp
- **Key nuance:** This measures AI-related *investment spending*, not AI-driven *productivity gains*

## 5. The Solow Paradox Repeating

### Key sources that explicitly draw the parallel:

**AEI:** "The AI Paradox: When Will Artificial Intelligence Boost US Economic Growth?"
- ~80% of companies report using gen AI, yet just as many report no significant bottom-line impact
- ~90% of transformative vertical use cases stuck in pilot mode
- Source: [AEI](https://www.aei.org/articles/the-ai-paradox-when-will-artificial-intelligence-boost-us-economic-growth/)

**BNP Paribas (Sep 2025):**
- Gen AI may have increased labor productivity by up to 1.3% since ChatGPT launch
- Based on time savings, not visible in aggregate statistics

### Key framing for the blog:
> "You can see AI everywhere except in the productivity statistics." AI adoption surged past 45% among workers, AI investment drove 39% of GDP growth, Q3 2025 headline productivity was a strong 4.9%. But when economists look at whether AI itself is *causing* that productivity growth, the signal vanishes. Kansas City Fed, San Francisco Fed, and Penn Wharton all converge: AI adoption explains little of the aggregate productivity shift.

## 6. GPT-5.2 Theoretical Physics Breakthrough (Feb 13, 2026)

- GPT-5.2 derived a new result in theoretical physics: a formula for single-minus gluon tree amplitudes that physicists assumed were zero for decades
- Found a kinematic regime ("half-collinear regime") where the amplitude is non-zero
- Involved a 12-hour scaffolded reasoning session producing a formal mathematical proof
- Co-authored with researchers from IAS, Vanderbilt, Cambridge, Harvard
- Preprint: "Single-minus gluon tree amplitudes are nonzero" on arXiv
- Results already extended from gluons to gravitons
- First time an AI model contributed an original discovery to theoretical physics
