# AI Productivity Gap Blog -- Voice Rewrite Design

## Goal

Rewrite the draft to read like a Stratechery-style informed opinion piece.
Personal thesis drives; research supports but does not dominate.

## Voice

- First person throughout. "I saw," "I tested," "my teams."
- 2 strong studies per claim, max. 1 counterpoint only if natural.
- Target ~12 sources total (down from 25+).
- No em-dashes. Use -- throughout.

## Structure (unchanged)

All sections and subsections stay. Same claims, same order.
